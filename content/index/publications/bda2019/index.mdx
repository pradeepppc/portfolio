This paper proposes new area of itemset mining called Spatial High Utility Frequent Itemset Mining (SHUFIM). SHUFIM aims to discover all itemsets in a spatiotemporal database that satisfy the user-specified minimum utility (minUtil), maximum distance (maxDist) and minimum support (minSup) constraints. It expands the existing High Utility Frequent Itemset mining by including the spatial nature of the items.

The paper was accepted in Big Data Analytics 2019 conference.
