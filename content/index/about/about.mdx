Hi, thanks for visiting my website. I am born in 1999 in the Indian state of Telangana. I grew up in the digital age. Throughout my childhood, I have witnessed many significant changes the digital revolution has brought into our life. Let it be the internet usage, increased data speeds, the transition from regular phones to smartphones, or even the development of better quality games. With every innovation, my eagerness to learn the tech behind it only grew more prominent.

Like many kids, I had my first interaction with the computer through a game. I still had the slightest memory of how interesting and fascinating it was while playing that game. As a teenager, this passion only grew more significant and introduced me to coding.

After school, I have started my Bachelor's program integrated with a master's in computer science at the International Institute Of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT - H). I am part of the Data Science and Analytics Center (DSAC) lab at IIIT-H. I have published few papers in reputed conferences and have a journal to my name in the data mining area. I am lucky enough to work with a startup in my sophomore, which helped me develop as an engineer. I have done my internship at VISA, during which our team won the hackathon for creating the app, which is a value-added service for cardholders.

Currently, I am working as senior software engineer at VISA where i am working on making next generation of VISANET system a distributed open system that is going to replace the traditional mainframe system.
